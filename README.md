# Link2Image

The motivation for this little script arrived when a family member had to use a program which only copied links into Word, but not the images to which they pointed. I wrote this script to help quickly replace the images.

##Usage

To run the program, add an icon or keyboard shortcut to the program. When running it, the script goes through all links in the active document, asking for each if it should be replaced. When selecting Yes, the image is replaced and the next link is selected. If the link points to an image on the Internet, it may take a moment to download the image. All images are saved in the document.
